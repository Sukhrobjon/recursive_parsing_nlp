1. Open your browser and navigate to https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery so the BigQuery Web UI loads.  
2. Verify you are in the correct GCP project (look at the blue project-name drop-down in the top bar). If not, click the drop-down and pick the intended project.  
3. In the left “Explorer” panel, locate the dataset that contains the table named catalog_items. If the dataset list is collapsed, click the small gray triangle ▸ next to your project name to expand it.  
4. Click the gray ▸ triangle to the left of that dataset so all its tables appear.  
5. Click once on catalog_items. The schema tab opens on the right; quickly confirm the three columns we will sort on exist (Created_by, Flow, Classic_Mobile_Picture_Type). Note the exact spelling—BigQuery is case-sensitive for column names.  
6. Click the +COMPOSE NEW QUERY button (just above the schema panel). A new blank query editor tab appears in the main workspace.  
7. Type the following SQL exactly into the editor:  

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  `your_project.your_dataset.catalog_items`
ORDER BY
  Created_by DESC,
  Flow DESC,
  Classic_Mobile_Picture_Type DESC;
```  

   • Replace your_project.your_dataset with the actual project and dataset names you saw in Step 3.  
   • We use ORDER BY with DESC after every column to enforce descending order, matching the requested priority: first by Created by, then within that by Flow, and finally by Classic Mobile_Picture_Type.  
8. Click the blue ▷ RUN button in the toolbar (or press Ctrl+Enter) to execute the query.  
9. Watch the “Query results” panel that appears at the bottom. When the green check-mark and timing information show up, we know the query finished successfully. We can see the rows now sorted exactly as specified.  
10. (Optional) To keep the results, click the SAVE RESULTS button on the right side of the “Query results” header. Choose “CSV (local file)” if you need a download, or “Save to a table” if you want to store it back in BigQuery for later use. Follow the on-screen prompts, naming the file or destination table appropriately.  
11. If you expect to reuse this query, click the floppy-disk icon (Save) in the query editor’s top bar, give the script a name like “catalog_items_sorted_desc”, and click SAVE so teammates can find it later in the Saved Queries pane.
