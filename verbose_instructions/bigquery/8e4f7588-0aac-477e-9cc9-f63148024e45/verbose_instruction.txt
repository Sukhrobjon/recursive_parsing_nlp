1) Navigate to https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery so the BigQuery console opens in your browser.  
2) Look at the left-side Resources panel and locate the public project bigquery-public-data.  
3) Click the grey triangle ▸ to the left of bigquery-public-data to expand its datasets list.  
4) Scroll down and click the grey triangle ▸ beside covid19_open_data to reveal its tables.  
5) Click the table name covid19_open_data (it appears as bigquery-public-data › covid19_open_data › covid19_open_data) to display its Schema tab in the main window—confirm that the column cumulative_confirmed and the date column exist; we will need them shortly.  
6) Click the blue + Compose Query button near the top-right of the console to open a new Query editor tab.  
7) Write the SQL below into the blank editor pane:  

```sql
-- Total confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide on 2020-04-15
SELECT
  SUM(cumulative_confirmed) AS total_cases_worldwide
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
WHERE
  date = "2020-04-15";
```  

8) Click the blue ▷ Run button (top-center of the editor toolbar) to execute the query.  
9) Wait a few seconds; in the Query results pane that appears below, verify one row returns with the column total_cases_worldwide.  
10) Click the SAVE RESULTS button on the right side of the Query results header.  
11) In the drop-down menu, choose CSV (local file); a file download dialog appears.  
12) When prompted, save the file to your local machine’s default download folder.  
13) Open your system’s file explorer, navigate to the Downloads folder, and locate the newly downloaded .csv file (its default name will look like covid19_open_data_....csv).  
14) Rename that file to result.csv so the final path is ~/Downloads/result.csv—this is the file containing the worldwide total of confirmed COVID-19 cases on April 15 2020.
