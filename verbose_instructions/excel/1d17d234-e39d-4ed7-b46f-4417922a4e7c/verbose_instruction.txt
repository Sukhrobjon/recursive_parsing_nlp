1. Right-click the “Sheet1” tab (or any existing sheet tab) at the bottom of the Excel window.  
2. Click “Insert” (if you are in older versions) or choose “Insert ➜ Insert Sheet”; in modern Excel simply click the “+” icon to add a new sheet.  
3. Type Sheet2 in the sheet-name field and press ENTER so the new tab now shows “Sheet2”. Confirm we have switched to this blank sheet.

4. Click cell A1 to make it the active cell.  
5. Hold the left mouse button and drag right to cell C1 so that the range A1:C1 is highlighted.  
6. On the Ribbon, click the “Home” tab, then click the “Merge & Center” button in the Alignment group. Excel will merge A1:C1 and place the cursor in the merged cell.  
7. Type Investment Summary and press ENTER. You should now see the text centered across the merged A1:C1 range.

8. Click cell A2.  
9. While holding the mouse button, drag right to cell B2 so A2:B2 is selected.  
10. Click the “Merge & Center” button again to merge those two cells.  
11. Type High Interest Rate and press ENTER. Verify that the phrase appears centered across A2:B2.

12. Click cell C2.  
13. Drag right to cell D2 so C2:D2 is highlighted.  
14. Click “Merge & Center” to merge these two cells.  
15. Type Low Interest Rate and press ENTER. Confirm that “Low Interest Rate” is centered across C2:D2.

16. Review: Row 1 should show the single merged header “Investment Summary”; row 2 should display two side-by-side merged cells labeled “High Interest Rate” and “Low Interest Rate.” Save the workbook with Ctrl+S to keep your changes.
