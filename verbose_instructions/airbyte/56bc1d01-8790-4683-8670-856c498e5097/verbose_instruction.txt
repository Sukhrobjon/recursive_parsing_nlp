1) Click the “Destinations” icon on the left sidebar of the Airbyte UI so we can review where Airbyte writes the SQLite file.  
2) Click the row that shows “Local SQLite” to open the destination settings drawer.  
3) Read the field labelled “destination_path”; you should see “/local/epidemiology.sqlite”. Note that “/local” is only a placeholder that Docker remaps.  
4) Recall that Airbyte’s Docker-compose sets the environment variable LOCAL_ROOT to “/tmp/airbyte_local”, so the actual file location in the running container is “/tmp/airbyte_local/epidemiology.sqlite”. We will use this full path in a moment.  

5) Switch to the Ubuntu desktop and Click the black “Terminal” icon () on the left launcher to open a shell.  
6) Type the following command to list all running containers and press Enter:  
```bash
docker ps
```  
7) Look for the line containing the IMAGE name “airbyte/server”. Copy or note the first column (CONTAINER ID). If you prefer to grab it automatically, run:  
```bash
container_id=$(docker ps | grep "airbyte/server" | awk '{print $1}')
echo $container_id   # we can see the collected ID
```  

8) Run the docker cp command to copy the database file out of the container and place it on your Desktop:  
```bash
docker cp ${container_id}:/tmp/airbyte_local/epidemiology.sqlite ~/Desktop/epidemiology.sqlite
```  
9) Execute ls to verify that the file now exists on the Desktop:  
```bash
ls -lh ~/Desktop/epidemiology.sqlite
```  
   We should see the file size and date; this confirms the copy succeeded.  

10) Double-click epidemiology.sqlite on the Desktop (or open it with sqlitebrowser / sqlite3) to confirm it opens without error. The data is now safely stored outside the Airbyte container and can be backed up or shared as needed.
