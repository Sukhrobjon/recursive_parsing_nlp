1. Navigate to the BigQuery console and expand the project `bigquery-public-data`, then drill down to the dataset `ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce`.
2. Verify that the seven daily tables `events_20210101` … `events_20210107` are present; these cover the full 7-day window we need.
3. Click any one table (e.g., `events_20210107`) to preview its schema and confirm key columns:
   • `user_pseudo_id` – GA4’s anonymous user identifier  
   • `event_name` – name of the GA4 event  
   • `event_params` – repeated RECORD that stores parameters such as `engagement_time_msec`
4. Still on the schema tab, expand `event_params` and find the nested field `key` / `value.int_value`; note that the parameter we need is `engagement_time_msec`.
5. Open the Query editor and start a new query.
6. Write a SELECT that reads all seven tables at once with a wildcard suffix:
   ```
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_202101*`
   ```
   We’ll restrict it to `*_01`–`*_07` shortly.
7. Add a WHERE clause to (a) keep only the seven target dates, (b) isolate `user_engagement` events, and (c) extract positive engagement time:
   ```
   WHERE _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '01' AND '07'          -- dates 2021-01-01 to 2021-01-07
     AND event_name = 'user_engagement'
   ```
8. UNNEST the `event_params` array so we can pull `engagement_time_msec`; add it to the SELECT list with SAFE_CAST:
   ```
   SELECT
     user_pseudo_id,
     event_date,
     SAFE_CAST(
       (SELECT value.int_value
        FROM UNNEST(event_params)
        WHERE key = 'engagement_time_msec') AS INT64
     ) AS engagement_time_msec
   ```
9. Wrap steps 6-8 in a CTE called `engagement` for readability:
   ```
   WITH engagement AS (
     SELECT
       user_pseudo_id,
       event_date,
       SAFE_CAST(
         (SELECT value.int_value
          FROM UNNEST(event_params)
          WHERE key = 'engagement_time_msec') AS INT64
       ) AS engagement_time_msec
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_202101*`
     WHERE _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '01' AND '07'
       AND event_name = 'user_engagement'
   )
   ```
10. Create a second CTE `seven_day` that captures every user with positive engagement time in the full 7-day window:
    ```
    , seven_day AS (
      SELECT DISTINCT user_pseudo_id
      FROM engagement
      WHERE engagement_time_msec > 0
        AND event_date BETWEEN '20210101' AND '20210107'
    )
    ```
11. Create a third CTE `two_day` that captures every user with positive engagement time in just the final 2 days (Jan 6–7):
    ```
    , two_day AS (
      SELECT DISTINCT user_pseudo_id
      FROM engagement
      WHERE engagement_time_msec > 0
        AND event_date BETWEEN '20210106' AND '20210107'
    )
    ```
12. Write the final SELECT that counts users who are in `seven_day` but NOT in `two_day`:
    ```
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS distinct_users_7d_only
    FROM seven_day
    WHERE user_pseudo_id NOT IN (SELECT user_pseudo_id FROM two_day);
    ```
13. Combine the CTEs and final SELECT into one complete query in the editor.
14. Click “Run” to execute the query; wait for the results pane to display the count.
15. Review the result (single row, column `distinct_users_7d_only`) to obtain the number of distinct pseudo-users who had positive engagement in the 7-day window but none in the overlapping 2-day window.
16. Optionally, validate by:
    a. Running `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM seven_day;` to see total engaged users in 7 days.  
    b. Running `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM two_day;` to see engaged users in 2 days.  
    c. Cross-checking a sample user_id from the final set by querying their events and confirming no positive engagement on Jan 6–7.
17. Document the final count and save the query (File → Save) for reproducibility.
