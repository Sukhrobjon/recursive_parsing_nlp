1) Open your browser and log in to the data-warehouse web console that hosts the Olist dataset (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake Web UI, Redshift Query Editor).  
2) Click the “SQL workspace” (sometimes labelled “Query editor” or “Compose new query”) to open a blank SQL tab.  
3) Copy the entire SQL script below, which is already split into logical CTE blocks so you can easily follow each metric, and paste it into the editor:

```sql
/* STEP-0 :  Prepare a reusable view of delivered orders */
WITH delivered_orders AS (
    SELECT
        order_id,
        customer_id
    FROM
        olist_orders
    WHERE
        order_status = 'delivered'
),

/* STEP-1 :  Bring order-item rows that belong to delivered orders */
order_items_delivered AS (
    SELECT
        oi.*,
        d.customer_id           -- we keep the customer_id for later counts
    FROM
        olist_order_items AS oi
    JOIN delivered_orders AS d
      ON oi.order_id = d.order_id
),

/* STEP-2 :  Seller with most distinct customers */
customer_leader AS (
    SELECT
        seller_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS distinct_customers
    FROM
        order_items_delivered
    GROUP BY
        seller_id
    ORDER BY
        distinct_customers DESC
    LIMIT 1
),

/* STEP-3 :  Seller with highest profit (price – freight_value) */
profit_leader AS (
    SELECT
        seller_id,
        SUM(price - freight_value) AS total_profit
    FROM
        order_items_delivered
    GROUP BY
        seller_id
    ORDER BY
        total_profit DESC
    LIMIT 1
),

/* STEP-4 :  Seller with most delivered orders */
order_leader AS (
    SELECT
        seller_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS distinct_orders
    FROM
        order_items_delivered
    GROUP BY
        seller_id
    ORDER BY
        distinct_orders DESC
    LIMIT 1
),

/* STEP-5 :  Seller with most 5-star reviews (again, delivered orders only) */
five_star_leader AS (
    SELECT
        oi.seller_id,
        COUNT(*) AS five_star_reviews
    FROM
        order_items_delivered AS oi
    JOIN olist_order_reviews AS r
      ON oi.order_id = r.order_id
    WHERE
        r.review_score = 5
    GROUP BY
        oi.seller_id
    ORDER BY
        five_star_reviews DESC
    LIMIT 1
)

/* STEP-6 :  Compile all four winners into one tidy result set */
SELECT
    'Most distinct customers (delivered orders)' AS achievement,
    seller_id,
    distinct_customers        AS metric_value
FROM customer_leader

UNION ALL
SELECT
    'Highest profit (delivered orders)',
    seller_id,
    total_profit
FROM profit_leader

UNION ALL
SELECT
    'Most distinct orders (delivered orders)',
    seller_id,
    distinct_orders
FROM order_leader

UNION ALL
SELECT
    'Most 5-star reviews (on delivered orders)',
    seller_id,
    five_star_reviews
FROM five_star_leader;
```

4) Click the blue “Run” (or “Execute”) button in the top-right corner of the editor to launch the query.  
5) Wait until the status bar shows “Query complete” and a results grid appears.  
6) Verify each row:  
   a) Row 1 description should read “Most distinct customers (delivered orders)” and show one seller_id and a customer count > 0.  
   b) Row 2 description should read “Highest profit (delivered orders)” and display a numeric total_profit.  
   c) Row 3 description should read “Most distinct orders (delivered orders)” and display an order count.  
   d) Row 4 description should read “Most 5-star reviews (on delivered orders)” and display the review count.  
7) Click the “Save Results” icon (down-arrow on the results grid) if you need a CSV/JSON copy, or click “Save view” on the query tab to store the SQL as a reusable view inside your project.  
8) Share the final output or saved view link with stakeholders so they can independently validate the winning sellers.
