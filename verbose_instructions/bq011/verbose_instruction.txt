1) Navigate to console.cloud.google.com/bigquery in your browser and, if prompted, log in with the Google account that has BigQuery access.  
2) In the Explorer panel on the left, click the triangle ▸ next to “bigquery-public-data” to expand the public datasets list.  
3) Scroll down and click the triangle ▸ beside “ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce”; the seven daily tables for January 1-7 2021 appear.  
4) Click the table name events_20210101; in the main pane, switch to the Schema tab so we can review the columns.  
5) Scroll until you locate these two columns, noting their data types:  
   • user_pseudo_id (STRING) – the anonymous user identifier we will count.  
   • event_params (RECORD REPEATED) – an array that stores key/value pairs such as engagement_time_msec. We’ll extract its int_value later.  
6) Still on this table, glance at the event_name field—this will let us restrict to rows where event_name = "user_engagement". We will use that filter to make sure the event actually carries engagement_time_msec.  
7) At the top of the BigQuery pane, click the + COMPOSE NEW QUERY button (paper-and-pencil icon). A blank query editor tab opens.  
8) Paste the following SQL into the editor. It builds two sub-queries, one for the 7-day window (Jan 1-7 2021) and one for the 2-day window (Jan 6-7 2021), then returns users who appear only in the larger window.  

```sql
-- Distinct pseudo-users with positive engagement time in Jan 1-7 2021
-- but NOT in Jan 6-7 2021
WITH seven_day AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT user_pseudo_id
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*`
  WHERE _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20210101' AND '20210107'   -- 7-day period
    AND event_name = 'user_engagement'
    AND (
      SELECT value.int_value
      FROM UNNEST(event_params)
      WHERE key = 'engagement_time_msec'
    ) > 0                                               -- positive engagement
),
two_day AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT user_pseudo_id
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*`
  WHERE _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20210106' AND '20210107'   -- 2-day period
    AND event_name = 'user_engagement'
    AND (
      SELECT value.int_value
      FROM UNNEST(event_params)
      WHERE key = 'engagement_time_msec'
    ) > 0
)

SELECT COUNT(*) AS distinct_users_no_recent_engagement
FROM seven_day
WHERE user_pseudo_id NOT IN (SELECT user_pseudo_id FROM two_day);
```

9) Review the date filters: note we reference the pseudo-column _TABLE_SUFFIX to limit which daily shard tables participate—this is faster than scanning the entire wildcard.  
10) Confirm the subquery in the SELECT list counts only those user_pseudo_id values present in seven_day but absent from two_day.  
11) Click the blue ▸ RUN button in the query toolbar.  
12) Watch the Job Information panel on the right; once “Results” appears, the query has finished.  
13) In the bottom “Query results” grid, verify a single row with the column distinct_users_no_recent_engagement shows the answer (e.g., 1 234).  
14) Click SAVE RESULTS (upper-right of the results grid) and choose “CSV (local file)”.  
15) In the file-save dialog that opens, leave format CSV, click Download, and save the file to your default Downloads folder.  
16) Open your computer’s terminal (or Finder/Explorer) and go to the Downloads directory:  
    ```bash
    cd ~/Downloads
    ```  
17) Rename the downloaded file to result.csv so it is easy to locate:  
    ```bash
    mv *.csv result.csv
    ```  
18) Verify the file exists by listing the directory:  
    ```bash
    ls -l result.csv
    ```  
19) If you need to share the output, attach or upload ~/Downloads/result.csv as required.  
20) You have now successfully identified the count of distinct pseudo-users with positive engagement in the 7-day window but none in the final 2-day window and saved the result locally.
