1. Navigate to the left-hand “Files” sidebar and locate the top-right blue button labeled “New”.  
2. Click the “New” button and select “Python 3 (ipykernel)” (or the default Python kernel shown) from the drop-down list. A new untitled notebook opens in a separate tab.  
3. Click the current notebook title “Untitled” at the top center; a rename dialog appears.  
4. Type `tensor.ipynb` into the text box and press Enter (or click “Rename”). The notebook tab now shows “tensor.ipynb”.  
5. Switch back to the “Files” sidebar by clicking the browser tab or panel where you can see your directory tree.  
6. Double-click the file `code.py` located in the Desktop folder (`Desktop/code.py`). Its contents open in a text preview pane.  
7. Press Ctrl + A (Cmd + A on macOS) to select the entire code, then press Ctrl + C (Cmd + C) to copy it to the clipboard.  
8. Switch to the “tensor.ipynb” notebook tab we just created.  
9. Click inside the first (empty) code cell so you see the blue vertical cursor bar.  
10. Paste the copied code by pressing Ctrl + V (Cmd + V on macOS). All lines from `code.py` now appear in this single cell.  
11. Verify that the pasted code starts with the first line of `code.py` and ends with the last line to confirm nothing is missing.  
12. Skip running the cell—no execution is required for this task; simply leave the code as-is.
