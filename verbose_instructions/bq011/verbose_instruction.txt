1. First, open the BigQuery console (https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery) and make sure the project that contains the public GA4 sample dataset is selected.  
2. Navigate to the dataset `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce` in the Explorer panel on the left.  
3. Verify the seven daily partitioned tables are present: `events_20210101` through `events_20210107`.  
4. Identify the key columns we will need:  
   • `event_name` – to isolate the `user_engagement` event.  
   • `event_params` – a repeated RECORD that contains the parameter `engagement_time_msec`.  
   • `pseudo_user_id` – the user identifier we will count.  
   • `event_timestamp` – to confirm date boundaries if needed (each table already represents a single day, but we still reference it in the CTE for clarity).  
5. Click the “+ Compose new query” button to open a blank query editor.  
6. Write a Common Table Expression (CTE) that unions the seven daily tables and extracts only those events with a positive `engagement_time_msec`. Start typing:  
```sql
WITH positive_engagement AS (
  SELECT
    pseudo_user_id,
    -- Extract engagement_time_msec from the nested event_params array
    (SELECT value.int_value
       FROM UNNEST(event_params)
      WHERE key = 'engagement_time_msec') AS engagement_time_msec,
    _TABLE_SUFFIX AS event_date   -- Each table’s suffix is the yyyymmdd date
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*`
  WHERE
    _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20210101' AND '20210107'       -- 7-day window
    AND event_name = 'user_engagement'
)
```  
7. Check the CTE logic by clicking the “Run” button with the cursor inside the CTE block; confirm the query preview returns rows and the `engagement_time_msec` column is populated.  
8. Add a WHERE clause inside the CTE (or an outer SELECT) to keep only rows where `engagement_time_msec > 0`:  
```sql
AND (SELECT value.int_value
       FROM UNNEST(event_params)
      WHERE key = 'engagement_time_msec') > 0
```  
   (If you already included the extraction as a column, apply `WHERE engagement_time_msec > 0` instead.)  
9. Create two derived CTEs to separate the 7-day users and the 2-day users:  
```sql
, seven_day_users AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT pseudo_user_id
  FROM positive_engagement
  WHERE event_date BETWEEN '20210101' AND '20210107'
)
, two_day_users AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT pseudo_user_id
  FROM positive_engagement
  WHERE event_date BETWEEN '20210106' AND '20210107'
)
```  
10. Write the final SELECT to count users who appear in `seven_day_users` but not in `two_day_users`:  
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS distinct_users_7d_not_2d
FROM
  seven_day_users s
LEFT JOIN
  two_day_users t
ON
  s.pseudo_user_id = t.pseudo_user_id
WHERE
  t.pseudo_user_id IS NULL;
```  
11. Combine everything into one complete query in the editor:  
```sql
WITH positive_engagement AS (
  SELECT
    pseudo_user_id,
    (SELECT value.int_value
       FROM UNNEST(event_params)
      WHERE key = 'engagement_time_msec') AS engagement_time_msec,
    _TABLE_SUFFIX AS event_date
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*`
  WHERE
    _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20210101' AND '20210107'
    AND event_name = 'user_engagement'
),
filtered_engagement AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM positive_engagement
  WHERE engagement_time_msec > 0
),
seven_day_users AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT pseudo_user_id
  FROM filtered_engagement
  WHERE event_date BETWEEN '20210101' AND '20210107'
),
two_day_users AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT pseudo_user_id
  FROM filtered_engagement
  WHERE event_date BETWEEN '20210106' AND '20210107'
)
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS distinct_users_7d_not_2d
FROM
  seven_day_users s
LEFT JOIN
  two_day_users t
ON
  s.pseudo_user_id = t.pseudo_user_id
WHERE
  t.pseudo_user_id IS NULL;
```  
12. Click the “Run” button to execute the full query.  
13. Review the Results panel; the value in `distinct_users_7d_not_2d` is the number of pseudo users who had positive engagement time during Jan 1-7 but none on Jan 6-7.  
14. (Optional) Validate by spot-checking a few `pseudo_user_id`s:  
    a. Modify the final SELECT to list `s.pseudo_user_id` instead of counting.  
    b. Run the query again and manually inspect some of those users in the raw tables to confirm they meet the criteria.  
15. Document the final count and save the query to a saved query folder for future reference.
