1. Log in to the instance and click the application picker (waffle icon); type “Analytics Center” and press Enter so the Analytics Center homepage loads.  
2. Click the blue “New → SQL Query” button in the upper-right corner to open the SQL editor panel.  
3. Type the following query to find which primary_collision_factor_violation_category produced the largest number of crashes in 2021:  
```sql
SELECT
       primary_collision_factor_violation_category,
       COUNT(*)            AS collision_count_2021
FROM   collisions
WHERE  YEAR(date) = 2021
GROUP  BY primary_collision_factor_violation_category
ORDER  BY collision_count_2021 DESC
LIMIT  1;
```  
4. Press Ctrl + Enter (or click “Run”) to execute the query; wait for the result grid to appear.  
5. Hover over the single row returned and copy the value in the primary_collision_factor_violation_category column (we will call it `<TOP_CATEGORY>` in the next steps).  
6. Without closing the editor, highlight the previous SQL statement, delete it, and paste the next block to compute the 2021 share of that same category (replace `<TOP_CATEGORY>` with the value you copied):  
```sql
WITH
    tot_2021 AS (
        SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_2021
        FROM   collisions
        WHERE  YEAR(date) = 2021
    ),
    cat_2021 AS (
        SELECT COUNT(*) AS cat_count_2021
        FROM   collisions
        WHERE  YEAR(date) = 2021
          AND  primary_collision_factor_violation_category = '<TOP_CATEGORY>'
    )
SELECT
    '<TOP_CATEGORY>'                               AS category,
    ROUND(100.0 * cat_count_2021 / total_2021, 2)  AS share_2021_pct
FROM cat_2021, tot_2021;
```  
7. Run the query and note the numeric value shown in column share_2021_pct (for example, 18.37).  
8. Highlight the entire SQL again, delete it, and paste the next block to calculate the same category’s share for the year 2011:  
```sql
WITH
    tot_2011 AS (
        SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_2011
        FROM   collisions
        WHERE  YEAR(date) = 2011
    ),
    cat_2011 AS (
        SELECT COUNT(*) AS cat_count_2011
        FROM   collisions
        WHERE  YEAR(date) = 2011
          AND  primary_collision_factor_violation_category = '<TOP_CATEGORY>'
    )
SELECT
    '<TOP_CATEGORY>'                               AS category,
    ROUND(100.0 * cat_count_2011 / total_2011, 2)  AS share_2011_pct
FROM cat_2011, tot_2011;
```  
9. Click “Run” and write down the share_2011_pct value shown in the result grid (e.g., 22.45).  
10. Replace the SQL in the editor with the final combined query below to calculate the exact percentage-point change in one shot (again, substitute `<TOP_CATEGORY>` with the copied category value):  
```sql
WITH
    top_cat        AS (SELECT '<TOP_CATEGORY>' AS category),
    tot_2021       AS (SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_2021  FROM collisions WHERE YEAR(date)=2021),
    tot_2011       AS (SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_2011  FROM collisions WHERE YEAR(date)=2011),
    cat_2021       AS (SELECT COUNT(*) AS cat_count_2021 FROM collisions c JOIN top_cat t
                        ON c.primary_collision_factor_violation_category = t.category
                       WHERE YEAR(c.date)=2021),
    cat_2011       AS (SELECT COUNT(*) AS cat_count_2011 FROM collisions c JOIN top_cat t
                        ON c.primary_collision_factor_violation_category = t.category
                       WHERE YEAR(c.date)=2011)
SELECT
    t.category,
    ROUND(100.0 * c21.cat_count_2021 / tot21.total_2021, 2) AS share_2021_pct,
    ROUND(100.0 * c11.cat_count_2011 / tot11.total_2011, 2) AS share_2011_pct,
    ROUND( (100.0 * c21.cat_count_2021 / tot21.total_2021)
         - (100.0 * c11.cat_count_2011 / tot11.total_2011), 2) AS pct_point_change
FROM top_cat t
CROSS JOIN cat_2021 c21
CROSS JOIN cat_2011 c11
CROSS JOIN tot_2021 tot21
CROSS JOIN tot_2011 tot11;
```  
11. Execute the query and view the four-column result row; confirm:  
    • Column category equals the value from step 5.  
    • Column pct_point_change is negative (indicating a decrease) and equals share_2021_pct ‑ share_2011_pct.  
12. Copy the pct_point_change value (e.g., ‑4.08) – this is the number of percentage points by which the category’s share fell from 2011 to 2021.  
13. Click the “Save as → Notebook” dropdown, choose “Save as View,” name it “Top Collision Factor Pct-Pt Change 2011-2021,” and press Save so the calculation can be reused later.  
14. Navigate back to the Analytics Center homepage and verify the new view appears under “My Saved Queries” with the correct last-run timestamp, confirming the task was completed successfully.
