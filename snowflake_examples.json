      "verbose_instruction": "Given the to-do list, we will finish all tasks following these detailed steps:\n1. Click the \"+ >> SQL Worksheet\" button on the top right of the main page.\n2. In the opened blanked page, first set the role to \"accountadmin\" via typing:\n`USE ROLE accountadmin;`\n3. Click the button with icon \"►\" in the upper-right corner of the worksheet;\n4. Next, select the warehouse and run it:\n`USE WAREHOUSE compute_wh;`\n5. The first task is to create a Snowflake database \"tasty_bytes\" with schema \"food\", we type in:\n`CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE tasty_bytes;`\nand run it to construct the database;\n6. As for the schema, similarly, we write down and run the following code in the worksheet:\n`CREATE OR REPLACE SCHEMA tasty_bytes.food;`\n7. Then, we create the target table \"menu\" in schema \"food\" to store the source data. Copy the following codes into the opened worksheet and run it:\n```\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE tasty_bytes.food.menu\n(\n    menu_id NUMBER,\n    menu_type_id NUMBER,\n    menu_type STRING,\n    truck_brand_name STRING,\n    menu_item_id NUMBER,\n    menu_item_name STRING,\n    item_category STRING,\n    item_subcategory STRING,\n    cost_of_goods_usd NUMBER,\n    sale_price_usd NUMBER,\n    menu_item_health_metrics_obj OBJECT\n);\n```\n8. Now, we have created the database, schema and table to store the data. We are going to create a stage that holds data files from Amazon S3. Type in:\n`CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE tasty_bytes.food.awsstage\nurl = 's3://sfquickstarts/tastybytes/raw_pos/menu/menu.csv.gz'\nfile_format = (type = csv);`\nRemember to execute it via clicking \"Run\" button in the upper-right corner of this worksheet.\n9. To load the data into the target table, we will use the COPY INTO command\n`COPY INTO tasty_bytes.food.menu\nFROM @tasty_bytes.food.awsstage;`\n, then select Run.\n10. After waiting for some seconds, we will see the results table with status \"LOADED\" and 100 rows loaded.\nTill now, we have finished all jobs in the to-do list.",
